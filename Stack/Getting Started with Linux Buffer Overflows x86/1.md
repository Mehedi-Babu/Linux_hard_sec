Hello Friends, this series of blog posts will purely focus on Buffer Overflows. When I started my journey in Infosec, this one topic fascinated me as much as it frightened me. When I read some of the blogs related to Buffer Overflows, it really seemed as some High-level gibber jabber containing C code, Assembly and some black terminals (Yeah I am talking about GDB). Over the period of time and preparing for OSCP, I started to learn about Buffer Overflows in detail referring to the endless materials on Web scattered over different planets. So, I will try to explain Buffer Overflow in depth and detail so everyone reading this blog can understand what actually a Buffer Overflow is.

In this blog, we will understand the basic fundamentals behind the Buffer Overflow vulnerability. Buffer Overflow is a memory corruption attack which involves memory, stack, buffers to name a few. We will go through each of this and understand why really Buffer Overflows takes place in the first place. We will focus on 32-bit architecture.

A little heads up: This blog is going to be a lengthy one because to understand the concepts of Buffer Overflow, we have to understand the process memory, stack, stack operations, assembly language and how to use a debugger. I will try to explain as much as I can. So I strongly suggest to stick till the end and it will surely clear your concepts. Also, from the next blog I will try to keep it short :p :p

So lets get started….
Before getting to stack and buffers, it is really important to understand the Process Memory Organization. Process Memory is the main playground where it all happens. In theory, the Process memory where the program/process resides is quite a complex place. We will see the basic part which we need for Buffer Overflow. It consists of three main regions: Text, Data and Stack.

**Text:** The Text region contains the Program Code (basically instructions) of the executable or the process which will be executed. The Text area is marked as read-only and writing any data to this area will result into Segmentation Violation (Memory Protection Mechanism).

Data: The Data region consists of the variables which are declared inside the program. This area has both initialized (data defined while coding) and uninitialized (data declared while coding) data. Static variables are stored in this section.

Stack: While executing a program, there are many function and procedure calls along with many JUMP instructions which after the functions work is done has to return to its next intended place. To carry out this operation, to execute a program, the memory has an area called Stack. Whenever the CALL instruction is used to call a function, the stack is used. The Stack is basically a data structure which works on the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. That means the last object entering the stack is the first object to get out. We will see how a stack works in detail below.

To understand more about the Process Memory read this fantastic article: https://www.bottomupcs.com/elements_of_a_process.xhtml

So Lets see an Assembly Code Skeleton to understand more about how the program is executed in Process Memory.

Here, as we can see the assembly program skeleton has three sections: .data, .bss and .txt

-> .txt section contains the assembly code instructions which resides in the Text section of the process memory.

-> .data section contains the initialized data or lets say defined variables or data types which resides in the Data section of the process memory.

-> .bss section contains the uninitialized data or lets say declared variables that will be used later in the program execution which also resides in the Data section of the process memory

However in a traditionally compiled program there may be many sections other than this.

Now the most important part….

HOLY STACK!!!
