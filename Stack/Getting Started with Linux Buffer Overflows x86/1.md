Hello Friends, this series of blog posts will purely focus on Buffer Overflows. When I started my journey in Infosec, this one topic fascinated me as much as it frightened me. When I read some of the blogs related to Buffer Overflows, it really seemed as some High-level gibber jabber containing C code, Assembly and some black terminals (Yeah I am talking about GDB). Over the period of time and preparing for OSCP, I started to learn about Buffer Overflows in detail referring to the endless materials on Web scattered over different planets. So, I will try to explain Buffer Overflow in depth and detail so everyone reading this blog can understand what actually a Buffer Overflow is.

In this blog, we will understand the basic fundamentals behind the Buffer Overflow vulnerability. Buffer Overflow is a memory corruption attack which involves memory, stack, buffers to name a few. We will go through each of this and understand why really Buffer Overflows takes place in the first place. We will focus on 32-bit architecture.

A little heads up: This blog is going to be a lengthy one because to understand the concepts of Buffer Overflow, we have to understand the process memory, stack, stack operations, assembly language and how to use a debugger. I will try to explain as much as I can. So I strongly suggest to stick till the end and it will surely clear your concepts. Also, from the next blog I will try to keep it short :p :p

So lets get started….
Before getting to stack and buffers, it is really important to understand the Process Memory Organization. Process Memory is the main playground where it all happens. In theory, the Process memory where the program/process resides is quite a complex place. We will see the basic part which we need for Buffer Overflow. It consists of three main regions: Text, Data and Stack.

**Text:** The Text region contains the Program Code (basically instructions) of the executable or the process which will be executed. The Text area is marked as read-only and writing any data to this area will result into Segmentation Violation (Memory Protection Mechanism).

Data: The Data region consists of the variables which are declared inside the program. This area has both initialized (data defined while coding) and uninitialized (data declared while coding) data. Static variables are stored in this section.

Stack: While executing a program, there are many function and procedure calls along with many JUMP instructions which after the functions work is done has to return to its next intended place. To carry out this operation, to execute a program, the memory has an area called Stack. Whenever the CALL instruction is used to call a function, the stack is used. The Stack is basically a data structure which works on the LIFO (Last In First Out) principle. That means the last object entering the stack is the first object to get out. We will see how a stack works in detail below.

To understand more about the Process Memory read this fantastic article: https://www.bottomupcs.com/elements_of_a_process.xhtml

So Lets see an Assembly Code Skeleton to understand more about how the program is executed in Process Memory.

![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/Linux_hardening_and_security/blob/master/Stack/Getting%20Started%20with%20Linux%20Buffer%20Overflows%20x86/wall/1.2.png)

Here, as we can see the assembly program skeleton has three sections: .data, .bss and .txt

-> .txt section contains the assembly code instructions which resides in the Text section of the process memory.

-> .data section contains the initialized data or lets say defined variables or data types which resides in the Data section of the process memory.

-> .bss section contains the uninitialized data or lets say declared variables that will be used later in the program execution which also resides in the Data section of the process memory

However in a traditionally compiled program there may be many sections other than this.

Now the most important part….

HOLY STACK!!!

As we discussed earlier all the dirty work is done on the Stack. Stack is nothing but a region of memory where data is temporarily stored to carry out some operations. There are mainly two operations performed by stack: PUSH and POP. PUSH is used to add the object on top of the stack, POP is used to remove the object from top of the stack.

But why stack is used in the first place?

Most of the programs have functions and procedures in them. So during the program execution flow, when the function is called, the flow of control is passed to the stack. That means when the function is called, all the operations which will take place inside the function will be carried out on the Stack. Now, when we talk about flow of control, after when the execution of the function is done, the stack has to return the flow of control to the next instruction after which the function was called in the program. This is a very important feature of the stack.

So, lets see how the Stack works. But before that, lets get familiar with some stack pointers and registers which actually carries out everything on the Stack.

ESP (Extended Stack Pointer): ESP is a stack register which points to the top of the stack.

EBP (Extended Base Pointer): EBP is a stack register which points to the top of the current frame when a function is called. EBP generally points to the return address. EBP is really essential in the stack operations because when the function is called, function arguments and local variables are stored onto the stack. As the stack grows the offset of both the function arguments and variables changes with respect to ESP. So ESP is changed many times and it is difficult for the compiler to keep track, hence EBP was introduced. When the function is called, the value of ESP is copied into EBP, thus making EBP the offset reference point for other instructions to access and calculate the memory addresses.

EIP (Extended Instruction Pointer): EIP is a stack register which tells the processor about the address of the next instruction to execute.

RET (return) address: Return address is basically the address to which the flow of control has to be passed after the stack operation is finished.

Stack Frame: A stack frame is a region on stack which contains all the function parameters, local variables, return address, value of instruction pointer at the time of a function call.

Okay, so now lets see the stack closely by executing a C program. For this blog post we will be using the program challenge ‘stack0’ from Protostar exploit series, which is a stack based buffer overflow challenge series.
You can find more about Protostar exploit series here -> https://exploit-exercises.com/protostar/

The program:

```c
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <stdio.h>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  volatile int modified;
  char buffer[64];

  modified = 0;
  gets(buffer);

  if(modified != 0) {
      printf("you have changed the 'modified' variable\n");
  } else {
      printf("Try again?\n");
  }
}
```

Whats the program about ?
An int variable modified is declared and a char array buffer of 64 bytes is declared. Then modified is set to 0 and user input is accepted in buffer using gets() function. The value of modified is checked, if its anything other than 0 then the message “you have changed the ‘modified’ variable” will be printed or else “Try again?” will be printed.

Lets execute the program once and see what happens.


![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/Linux_hardening_and_security/blob/master/Stack/Getting%20Started%20with%20Linux%20Buffer%20Overflows%20x86/wall/1.4.png)


So after executing the program, it asks for user input, after giving the string “IamGrooooot” it displays “Try again?”. By seeing the output it is clear that modified variable is still 0.

Now lets try to debug this executable in a debugger, we will be using GDB throughout this blogpost series (Why? Because its freaking awesome).

Just type gdb ./executable_name to execute the program in the debugger.

The first thing we do after firing up gdb is disassembling the main() function of our program.


![](https://github.com/nu11secur1ty/Linux_hardening_and_security/blob/master/Stack/Getting%20Started%20with%20Linux%20Buffer%20Overflows%20x86/wall/1.5.png)

We can see the main() function now, its in assembly language. So lets try to understand what actually this means.

From the address 0x080483f4 the main() function is getting started.
-> Since there is no arguments passed in the main function, directly the EBP is pushed on the stack.
As we know EBP is the base pointer on the stack, the Stack pushes some starting address onto the EBP and saves it for later purposes.

-> Next, the value of ESP is moved into EBP. The value of ESP is saved into EBP. This is done so that most of the operations carried out by the function arguments and the variable changes the ESP and it is difficult for the compiler to keep track of all the changes in ESP.

-> Many times the compiler add some instructions for better alignment of the stack. The instruction at the address 0x080483f7 is masking the ESP and adding some trailing zeros to the ESP. This instruction is not important to us.

-> The next instruction at address 0x080483fa is subtracting 0x60 hex value from the ESP. Now the ESP is pointing to a far lower address from the EBP(As we know the stack grows down the memory). This gap between the ESP and EBP is basically the Stack frame, where the operations needed to execute the program is done.

-> Now the instruction at address 0x080483fd is from where all our C code will make sense. Here we can see the instruction movl $0x0,0x5c(%esp) where the value 0 is moved into ESP + the offset 0x5c, that means 0 is moved to the address [ESP+0x5c]. This is same as in our program, modified=0.

-> From address 0x08048405 to 0x0804840c are the instructions with accepts the user input.
The instruction lea 0x1c(%esp),%eax is loading the effective address i.e [ESP+0x1c] into EAX register. This address is pointing to the char array buffer on the stack. The lea and mov instructions are almost same, the only difference is the lea instruction copies the address of the register and offset into the destination instead of the content(which the mov instruction does).

-> The instruction mov %eax,(%esp) is copying the address stored in EAX register into ESP. So the top of the stack is pointing to the address 0x1c(%esp). Another important thing is that the function parameters are stored in the ESP. Assuming that the next instruction is calling gets function, the gets function will write the data to a char array. In this case the ESP is pointing to the address of the char buffer and the gets function writes the data to ESP(i.e the char array at the address 0x1c(%esp) ).

-> From the address 0x08048411 to 0x0804842e, the if condition is carried out. The instruction mov 0x5c(%esp),%eax is copying the value of modified variable i.e 0 into EAX. Then the test instruction is checking whether the value of modified is changed or not. If the value is not changed i.e the je instruction’s output is equal then the flow of control will jump to 0x08048427 where the message “Try again?” will be printed. If the value is changed then flow of control will be normal and the next instruction will be executed, thus printing the message “you have changed the ‘modified’ variable”.

-> Now all the opertions are done. But the stack is as it is and for the program to be completed the flow control has to be passed to the RET address which is stored on the stack. But till now only variables and addresses has been pushed on the stack but nothing has been popped. At the address 0x08048433 the leave instruction is executed. The leave instruction is used to “free” the stack frame. If we see the disassemble main() the first two instructions push %ebp and push %esp,%ebp, these instructions basically sets up the stack frame. Now the leave instruction does exactly the opposite of what the first two instructions did, mov %ebp,%esp and pop %ebp. So these two instructions free ups stack frame and the EIP points to the RET address which will give the flow of control to the address which was next after the called function. In this case the RET value is not pointing to anything because our program ends here.

So till now we have seen what our C code in Assembly means, it is really important to understand these things because when we debug or lets say Reverse Engineer some binary and stuff, this understanding of how closely the memory and stack works really comes in handy.

Now we will see the stack operations in GDB. For those who will be doing debugging and reversing for the first time it may feel overwhelming seeing all these instructions(believe me, I used to go nuts sometimes), so for the moment we will focus only on the part which is required for this series to understand, like where is our input being written, how the memory addresses can be overwritten and all those stuffs….

Here comes the mighty GDB !!!!

In GDB we will list the program, so we can know where we want to set a breakpoint.

We will set the breakpoint for line number 7,11,13
