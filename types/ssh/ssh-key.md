# Export and create a file "authorized_keys" if you don't have it

```
cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh user@x.x.x.x "mkdir -p ~/.ssh && cat >>  ~/.ssh/authorized_keys"
```
# Adding the next key on the client machine if you already have it him somewhere on this machine.

```
echo -e "_your_key_" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
