**NOTE**: This module is created to build file in Kernel virtual directory `proc` with special contend!
          Late I will buils another sofware which will pars information from this file and it will never interfere with the kernel.
          From Kernel base, the sitation is the same. The purpose of the module is to provide special data to the user space and back without breaking the rules


For a Debian GNU/Linux host, building a recent kernel, these are the dependencies you'll need to install:

      # apt-get install flex bison bc libelf-dev libssl-dev \
                        build-essential make libncurses5-dev \
                        git-core
